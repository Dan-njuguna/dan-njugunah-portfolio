          I also have experience with multiple AI frameworks such as langchain, openai and vertex-ai. I have also worked
          on RAG applications using huggingface provided models locally. I, however, enjoy writing more of AI first web applications
          as they have wide applications in various industries. In the future, I am working
          to bring AI solutions in the fields of Finance and Energy. To finance is to help

        <p>
          I love story telling. I more often than not fall in the pit of narrating stories endlessly.
          Outside technology, I love cycling and hiking. Gaming is also a part of what I do best. 
          I listen to a lot of Nyashinski and Sauti Sol musicðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶. Founder of - &apos;&apos;We Listen, but we don&apos;t judge!&apos;&apos;

          I&apos;m also very much into self-improvement, nutrition, and positive
          psychology.
